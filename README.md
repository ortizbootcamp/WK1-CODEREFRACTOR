Repo for Bootcamp Homework Week 1 - "Code Refractor"

Assignment: Request to clean up site code through the use of semantics tags, addition of alt tags, improving accesibility... Refactoring - which means to spruce up existing code without changing it's directive/how it looks etc.

I started this assignment by going through the HTML and changing semantics tags, then changing their matching CSS selectors. I commented changes in HTML.

After those changes, I went back in and added alt tags for all images.

Everything appears exactly as before but is more specific and looks a bit cleaner!
